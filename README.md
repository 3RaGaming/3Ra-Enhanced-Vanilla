Designed for factorio 0.14.13. All other versions not guaranteed to work

These are 3ragaming.com's custom Factorio Scenarios. Our "Vanilla Enhanced" scenario offers "vanilla" play wtih some added "soft modded" features to allow better server control and additional cool features that any player should enjoy.

A "Scenario" in factorio saves the control.lua file to the game save file, meaning any custom scripted mods within that file are available to any player who joins the server and download's the map. This offer's us flexibility in our modding to bypass the mod download requirement, and restart of factorio to play a server. There are some limitations, but the idea is to boost "vanilla" game play without requiring specifically picked mods to be downloaded.

If the Factorio dev's ever make Mod downloading a seamless rebootable process, our scenario method will no longer be needed. But until then, as they have not released if they will ever add that functionality, we will continue in our pursuits!

We've even got a few fun "non vanilla style" playable scenarios, like Free For All Battle Arena, Two team PVP, and Capture the flag! We will make as many more custom scenariosâ€™ as we can think of and create. Our biggest hope is that the factorio dev's will unlock more customizable or manageable aspects of their API to allow more freedom in custom scenario creation. 

You're welcome to download and play these as well. We just ask that you include "3Ra Scenario" (or something of the sort) somewhere in your server description or tags. If you use our scenario's, please leave our name in the file comments. Join our discord at www.3ragaming.com/discord and we can collaborate on fun idea's!
