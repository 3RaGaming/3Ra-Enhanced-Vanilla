# 3ragaming

3ragaming.com's game coding projects

Designed for factorio 0.14.14. All other versions not guaranteed to work.

Note: This build has been updated to include aspects of 0.15.0; which may introduce bugs due to behavior changes or errors made. If you run into any issues, please be sure to submit an issue on the github page.

This is 3Ra Gaming's Enhanced Vanilla scenario, offering standard Factorio gameplay with additional "soft-mods" that we believe make the game more fun to play and add convenience. As a scenario, it is automatically downloaded when a player joins, preventing the need for any mod installations. This also makes it easy for us to update the scenario with new features, without forcing players to change or update mods. 

Currently this scenario has the following features: Periodic server announcements, AutoDeconstruct which marks depleted mining drills for deconstruction, AutoFill which automatically fills objects such as furnaces and turrets with fuel or ammo when they are placed, Score Extended which gives additional information about rocket launch statistics and allows autolaunch, Resource Spawner Overhaul which changes map resource generation (ensure that the actual map settings are set to size "none" for all resources and enemies if using RSO, to configure the actual resource values edit rso-mapsettings.lua), Show Health which shows player health after damage, our tag GUI which allows players to show what they are working on in-game, admin tools such as spectate, follow and character modifiers, gravestone which saves player items in a chest upon death, undecorator which removes decorations in order to reduce file size, and map settings such as crosshatch and spiral to bring variety to the map.

While scenarios currently have some limitations, we hope that the Factorio devs will continue to work on the game and allow increased amounts of flexability in the API, allowing more advanced customizations of the game.

You can find many other scenarios under the 3Ra Gaming Github Organization, such as Free For All Battle Arena, Team vs Team PvP and even Capture the Flag! We will continue to update existing scenarios and create new ones, so join us at www.3ragaming.com/discord, whether you want to contribute to our development process or just want a fun multiplayer experience! 

Feel free to download and play with any of our scenarios. All we ask is that you include "3Ra Gaming Scenario" (or something of the sort) somewhere in your server description or tags, and leave our name in the file header for curious players to find. Thanks for reading, we hope you enjoy!
