3ragaming.com's game coding projects

Designed for factorio 0.14.14. All other versions not guaranteed to work.

This is 3Ra Gaming's "Enhanced Vanilla" scenario, offering standard Factorio gameplay with additional "soft-mods" that we believe make the game more fun to play and add convenience. As a scenario, it is automatically downloaded when a player joins, preventing the need for any mod installations. This also makes it easy for us to update the scenario with new features, without forcing players to change or update mods. 

While scenarios currently have some limitations, we hope that the Factorio devs will continue to work on the game and allow increased amounts of flexability in the API, allowing more advanced customizations of the game.

You can find many other scenarios under the 3Ra Gaming Github Organization, such as Free For All Battle Arena, Team vs Team PvP and even Capture the Flag! We will continue to update existing scenarios and create new ones, so join us at www.3ragaming.com/discord, whether you want to contribute to our development process or just want a fun multiplayer experience! 

Feel free to download and play with any of our scenarios. All we ask is that you include "3Ra Gaming Scenario" (or something of the sort) somewhere in your server description or tags, and leave our name in the file header for curious players to find. Thanks for reading, we hope you enjoy!
